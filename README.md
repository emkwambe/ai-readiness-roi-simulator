> **A parameterized Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model for strategic AI investment prioritization**

---

## 🎯 The Problem

**85% of AI projects fail to deliver expected value.** Yet organizations continue to select automation candidates through intuition, vendor hype, or executive mandate rather than systematic analysis.

### The Real Questions Nobody Asks:
- **Readiness**: Is this process actually mature enough for AI?
- **Return**: What's the realistic financial payback—not the vendor's projection?
- **Risk**: What happens when the AI gets it wrong? Compliance fines? Customer churn?

### Why Existing Approaches Fail:
| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Vendor assessments | Biased toward selling their solution |
| IT-led selection | Ignores business readiness and change management |
| Executive intuition | No systematic comparison across options |
| ROI-only analysis | Ignores risk and readiness constraints |

### This Model's Solution:
A **parameterized scoring framework** that evaluates every automation candidate against **11 research-backed metrics** across three dimensions, with **non-compensatory gates** that filter out high-risk or low-readiness processes—regardless of their ROI potential.

## 📊 Visualizations

### Priority Matrix
*Which processes should you automate first?*

![Priority Matrix](outputs/figures/fig1_priority_matrix.png)

**Insight**: Product Setup and Installation Support rank highest due to strong readiness scores and favorable ROI. Payment Issue and Data Loss are gated out despite decent ROI—the risk is simply too high.

---

### Risk-Readiness Quadrant
*Strategic positioning of all 16 process steps*

![Risk-Readiness Quadrant](outputs/figures/fig3_risk_readiness_quadrant.png)

**Insight**: The ideal quadrant (High Ready / Low Risk) contains your priority targets. Red-shaded regions indicate processes that fail gate thresholds and are excluded from prioritization.

---

### Monte Carlo Simulation (n=500)
*How stable are these recommendations under parameter uncertainty?*

![Monte Carlo](outputs/figures/fig4_monte_carlo.png)

**Key Finding**: "Product Setup" ranked #1 in **100% of 500 simulations** across varying weight combinations. The 90% confidence interval for annual savings is **$222K - $354K**.

---

### Scenario Comparison
*How do recommendations change under different strategic contexts?*

![Scenario Comparison](outputs/figures/fig5_scenario_comparison.png)

**Insight**: The Compliance-Heavy scenario gates out 5 processes (vs. 2 in Baseline), reducing potential savings by $67K but significantly lowering risk exposure.

---

### Weight Sensitivity Analysis
*Are rankings stable or fragile?*

![Weight Sensitivity](outputs/figures/fig6_weight_sensitivity.png)

**Validation**: Top 2 priorities remain stable across all 5 weight schemes tested, demonstrating robust recommendations that don't depend on precise parameter calibration.

## 🔬 Model Architecture

### Three-Dimensional Scoring

```
Priority = Gate × (w_readiness × R + w_roi × ROI + w_risk × Safety)
```

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Readiness** | 35% | Data availability, quality, process standardization, tooling |
| **ROI** | 45% | Payback period, annual savings ratio |
| **Risk** | 20% | Compliance exposure, customer harm potential, error tolerance |

### Non-Compensatory Gates

Unlike pure weighted-sum models, this framework includes **hard gates**:

- **Min Readiness Gate (50)**: Processes below this threshold are excluded—no amount of ROI can compensate for insufficient readiness
- **Max Risk Gate (70)**: High-risk processes are excluded regardless of other scores

### Parameter Justification

Every parameter is backed by industry research:

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| w_readiness = 0.35 | Gartner (2022): 85% of AI failures trace to readiness |
| w_roi = 0.45 | McKinsey (2023): ROI is primary criterion for 67% of decisions |
| min_readiness = 50 | Forrester (2022): <50 correlates with <50% success rate |
| shift_full = 0.70 | IBM Watson studies: 65-80% containment typical |
